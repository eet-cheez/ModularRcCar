# Modular RC Car
## Description
An RC car made of separate block pieces that can be attached together in tons of different configurations. This car was designed to use very little amounts of hardware, and if it did, they are cheap and widely availible. Each module is designed as a cube shaped frame that serves its own specific function, like steering, suspension, power, etc...
## Why I Made it
I decided on making an RC car using modular block parts because it makes customization, repair, and upgrades easier. If you wanted to design a better gearbox or have smoother suspension or use a bigger motor, you would only need to redesign and print one part. Same thing applies if a part gets damaged.
I was also kind of inspired by block building games like bad piggies where parts could be placed anywhere you want. If you felt like it, you could make the car super long and add more wheels. That's why I liked the modular idea.
